SimpleCloudNotifier is a app to display messages that you can send to your phone with a simple POST request to the right URL.

After you start the app it generates a UserID and a UserSecret.
Now you can send your message to https://simplecloudnotifier.blackforestbytes.com/send.php and a notification will be pushed to your phone.
(see https://simplecloudnotifier.blackforestbytes.com/ for an example with curl)


Use it to
 - send yourself automated messages from cron jobs
 - notify yourself when long-running scripts finish
 - send server error messages directly to your phone
 - integrate with other online services

The possibilities are endless*
